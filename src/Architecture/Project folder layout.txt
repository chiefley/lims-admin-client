Much of the source code is now organized by feature rather than function.   There is a src/features folder that contains folders for each major area, which are 
- prepBatchSop
- analyticalBatchSop
- basicTables
- labAssets
- dashboard
- shared

The api service is still one file for all the api methods.  That might be refactored in the future.

Besides being easier to navigate the source tree, it allows a selective inclusion of files into the Project Knowledge space during Vibe Coding.
